     In vertical order traversal, nodes that are part of same horizontal distance are clubbed together in
     hashmap value against key hd.

     Here, instead of clubbing the nodes present on same line, we will simply put the nodes of
     each line in map and keep overriding nodes present on same line, which will make sure that all top
     nodes of same line will arrive in map first and last node of same line will override the top nodes of
     same line, and hence map will have last nodes of each line.

     3. Print the map.

     See code for vertical order traversal. just override the values in the same key.

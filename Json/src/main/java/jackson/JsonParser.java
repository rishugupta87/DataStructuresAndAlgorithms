     * Because of its compact size, compared to XML and platform independence nature makes JSON a

     * which also provides streaming capability. It has no extenal dependency and solely depends on JDK. It is also powerful
     * and provides full binding support for common JDK classes as well as any Java Bean class, e.g. Player in our case. It also
     * provides data binding for Java Collection classes e.g. Map as well Enum.
